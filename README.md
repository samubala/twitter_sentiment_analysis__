# Social-Metric-Insight-Projects
This repository features a range of projects related to social media. The first project, 
'Twitter Sentiment Analysis', is designed to assist users in determining whether a given 
tweet is positive or negative. This can be particularly useful for businesses or individuals
who want to monitor public sentiment about their brand or a particular topic.


The second project, 'Ratings of Guvi Courses', is focused on helping the Guvi company 
predict the ratings that their courses will receive from learners. By doing so, the company
can identify areas where improvements are needed to enhance the overall learning experience
for their learners.

Each project offers unique insights and tools for analyzing and optimizing your social media strategy.

# 1.Twitter sentiment analysis:

The goal of this project is to create a model that can classify tweets as positive, negative, 
or neutral based on their content.This can be useful for sentiment analysis, brand monitoring, 
and other applications where it's important to understand how people feel about a particular 
topic or product. In order to accomplish this task, we need to preprocess the data, select 
appropriate features, and train a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.
